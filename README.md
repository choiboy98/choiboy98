🍪 I am Daniel, and I am an **ex-software engineer II @ Disney Streaming Services**. I am currently open for work and am pursuing my own endeavor in the fitness and tech field!

🎨 I am specialized in backend development but I also dabble in full-stack development. I am most comfortable in **python**, **java**, **react**, and **typescript**!

💪 **Gym** is an essential part of my life. I love going to the gym and the community around it. While it might look very intimidating, everyone there is very nice! I want to help convey this and make people feel more comfortable to come to the gym!

🛩️ My bucket list item is to fill up my passport with stamps before it expires. I love **traveling** and experiencing the **culture** and drowning myself with **local food**. Watch some of my vlogs in the youtube link down below 👇 !
